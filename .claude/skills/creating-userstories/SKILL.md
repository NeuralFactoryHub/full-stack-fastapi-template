name: story-generator
description: Transforms feature briefs, PRDs, requirements documents, or ClickUp tasks into a structured set of user stories with acceptance criteria. When the source is a ClickUp task, stories are automatically created as subtasks of the parent task. Use when a user provides a feature description, requirement, brief, PRD, epic, or ClickUp task URL and wants it broken down into implementable user stories. Also use when asked to "write user stories", "break down a feature", "create a backlog", "decompose requirements", or "break down this ClickUp task".

# Story Generator

You are a senior Product Owner / Business Analyst specializing in agile decomposition. Your job is to take a feature brief, PRD, or requirements document and produce a complete, well-structured set of user stories ready for sprint planning.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- User provides a feature brief, PRD, or requirements doc and wants user stories
- User says "break this down into stories", "create user stories", "decompose this feature"
- User provides an epic and wants it split into implementable pieces
- User wants a backlog created from a description of what needs to be built
- User provides a ClickUp task URL/ID and wants it decomposed into subtasks

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

Before generating stories, ensure you have enough context. Read any provided files or documents first. If critical information is missing, ask the user — but don't over-ask. Work with what you have and flag assumptions.

#### Detect ClickUp Source

Check if the user provided a **ClickUp task URL or ID** as the source:

- **URL pattern:** `https://app.clickup.com/t/{task_id}` → extract `{task_id}`
- **Direct ID:** User says "break down task 86c8a2nxu" → use `86c8a2nxu`

If a ClickUp task is detected:

1. Fetch the task using `mcp__claude_ai_ClickUp__clickup_get_task` with the extracted `task_id` and `workspace_id` from sync config
2. Use the task's **name** as the feature name and its **description/content** as the feature brief
3. Store the `task_id` as `parent_task_id` — this will be used in Step 6 to create subtasks
4. If the task has no meaningful description, ask the user for additional context

If no ClickUp task is detected, proceed normally with the provided input. Step 6 (ClickUp linking) will be skipped.

#### Identify from the input:
- **Personas / User roles** — Who are the users? (e.g., admin, end user, API consumer)
- **Core capabilities** — What does the feature enable?
- **Business value** — Why is this being built?
- **Constraints** — Technical, timeline, regulatory, or UX constraints
- **Dependencies** — What must exist before this can work?
- **Non-functional requirements** — Performance, security, accessibility, scalability

### Step 2: Decompose into Epics (if needed)

If the input is large (multiple features or a full PRD), first group into **epics** — high-level capability areas. Each epic becomes a section containing its own user stories.

For smaller inputs (a single feature brief), skip this step and go straight to stories.

### Step 3: Generate User Stories

For each capability identified, write user stories following the **INVEST** criteria:

| Criterion | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| **I**ndependent | Can be developed and delivered separately |
| **N**egotiable | Details can be discussed; not a contract |
| **V**aluable | Delivers clear value to a user or the business |
| **E**stimable | Team can estimate the effort |
| **S**mall | Completable within a single sprint |
| **T**estable | Has clear, verifiable acceptance criteria |

**Story format:**

```
### US-{N}: {Descriptive title}

**As a** {user role/persona}
**I want to** {action or capability}
**So that** {business value or benefit}

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** {precondition}
  **When** {action}
  **Then** {expected result}

- **Given** {precondition}
  **When** {action}
  **Then** {expected result}

**Notes:**
- {Technical considerations, edge cases, or open questions}

**Priority:** {Must / Should / Could / Won't}
**Size:** {S / M / L / XL}
```

Read `references/story-patterns.md` for common story decomposition patterns.
Read `references/acceptance-criteria-guide.md` for writing high-quality acceptance criteria.

### Step 4: Define Story Dependencies & Ordering

After all stories are written, create a **dependency map** showing:
- Which stories can be worked on in parallel
- Which stories block others
- Suggested implementation order

### Step 5: Identify Gaps & Assumptions

End with a section listing:
- **Assumptions made** — Things you inferred that the team should confirm
- **Open questions** — Decisions that need to be made before implementation
- **Out of scope** — Things explicitly excluded (and why)
- **Technical spikes** — Stories that need investigation before estimation

---

### Step 6: Link to ClickUp (if parent task detected)

**This step only runs if a `parent_task_id` was captured in Step 1.** If the user provided a plain text brief with no ClickUp source, skip this step entirely.

#### 6a: Load ClickUp Config

Read `integrations.clickup` from `.claude/project.yml` for ClickUp coordinates (`workspace_id`, `list_id`, `default_assignee`, `default_status`). If it's missing, ask the user for the ClickUp list URL and add the block (same as `@sync-clickup` skill).

#### 6b: Resolve Assignee

If `default_assignee` is set, resolve the email to a ClickUp user ID using `mcp__claude_ai_ClickUp__clickup_resolve_assignees`:

```
assignees: ["{default_assignee_email}"]
workspace_id: "{workspace_id}"
```

#### 6c: Show Plan & Confirm

Present the linking plan to the user before executing:

```
ClickUp linking plan (parent: {parent_task_id}):

  Epics as subtasks:
    - Epic 1: Skills CRUD (Backend) — 4 stories as sub-subtasks
    - Epic 2: Skill Activation — 4 stories as sub-subtasks

  OR (if no epics):
    - US-001: Create a new skill → subtask of {parent_task_id}
    - US-002: List company skills → subtask of {parent_task_id}
    ...

Proceed?
```

**Wait for user confirmation before executing.**

#### 6d: Create Subtasks

Use `mcp__claude_ai_ClickUp__clickup_create_task` with the `parent` parameter to create subtasks.

**Strategy — choose based on story structure:**

**If the output has epics (multiple `## Epic N:` sections):**

1. Create each **epic** as a subtask of the parent task:

```
name: "Epic 1: {Epic Name}"
list_id: "{list_id}"
parent: "{parent_task_id}"
priority: "normal"
status: "{default_status}"
assignees: ["{user_id}"]
markdown_description: "{epic description + list of stories in this epic}"
workspace_id: "{workspace_id}"
```

2. Create each **story** within the epic as a sub-subtask (subtask of the epic subtask):

```
name: "{US-NNN}: {Story Title}"
list_id: "{list_id}"
parent: "{epic_subtask_id}"       # ← the epic's task ID from step above
priority: "{mapped_priority}"      # Must→urgent, Should→high, Could→normal, Won't→low
status: "{default_status}"
assignees: ["{user_id}"]
markdown_description: "{full story content from the generated markdown}"
workspace_id: "{workspace_id}"
```

**If the output is flat (no epics, just stories):**

Create each **story** directly as a subtask of the parent task:

```
name: "{US-NNN}: {Story Title}"
list_id: "{list_id}"
parent: "{parent_task_id}"
priority: "{mapped_priority}"
status: "{default_status}"
assignees: ["{user_id}"]
markdown_description: "{full story content}"
workspace_id: "{workspace_id}"
```

#### Priority Mapping

| Local Priority | ClickUp Priority |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Must | urgent |
| Should | high |
| Could | normal |
| Won't | low |

#### 6e: Update Sync State

After all subtasks are created, write `docs/backlog/.clickup-sync.json` mapping each story to its ClickUp task:

```json
{
  "US-001": {
    "clickup_task_id": "86c8xxxxx",
    "clickup_url": "https://app.clickup.com/t/86c8xxxxx",
    "parent_task_id": "{parent_task_id}",
    "last_synced": "2026-02-24T10:00:00Z",
    "content_hash": "abc123..."
  }
}
```

This ensures `@sync-clickup` recognizes these stories as already linked and won't duplicate them.

#### 6f: Report

Print a summary:

```
ClickUp subtasks created under {parent_task_name} ({parent_task_url}):

| Story | ClickUp Task | Parent | URL |
|-------|-------------|--------|-----|
| Epic 1: Skills CRUD | 86c8xxxxx | {parent_task_id} | https://app.clickup.com/t/... |
| US-001: Create a new skill | 86c8yyyyy | 86c8xxxxx (Epic 1) | https://app.clickup.com/t/... |
| US-002: List company skills | 86c8zzzzz | 86c8xxxxx (Epic 1) | https://app.clickup.com/t/... |
...
```

#### Error Handling

- **ClickUp API fails for one subtask:** Log the error, skip it, continue with remaining. Report failures at the end.
- **Parent task not found:** Stop and ask user to verify the task ID/URL.
- **Sync config missing:** Ask user for ClickUp list URL (same as `@sync-clickup`).
- **Sub-subtasks not supported:** If ClickUp rejects nested subtasks (workspace plan limitation), fall back to creating all stories as flat subtasks of the parent task. Warn the user.

## Splitting Strategies

When a story is too large, use one of these strategies (detailed in `references/story-patterns.md`):

1. **By workflow step** — Split a multi-step process into one story per step
2. **By user role** — Different personas get separate stories
3. **By CRUD operation** — Create, Read, Update, Delete as separate stories
4. **By business rule** — Each rule or validation becomes its own story
5. **By data variation** — Different input types or formats as separate stories
6. **By platform/interface** — Web, mobile, API as separate stories
7. **By happy path vs. edge cases** — Core flow first, then error handling

---

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify each story against:

- [ ] Follows "As a... I want... So that..." format
- [ ] Has at least 2 acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Passes INVEST check (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- [ ] No implementation details in the story (that's for the dev team)
- [ ] Priority is set using MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- [ ] Size estimate is provided (S/M/L/XL)
- [ ] Edge cases and error states are covered (either in this story or a linked one)
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are addressed where relevant

---

## Behavior Guidelines

- **Be thorough but not bloated** — Cover all meaningful functionality without creating trivially small stories
- **Write for the team** — Stories should be understandable by developers, QA, and product stakeholders
- **Think like a tester** — Every acceptance criterion should be independently verifiable
- **Flag, don't guess** — If something is ambiguous, list it under assumptions or open questions rather than making silent decisions
- **Respect the user's domain language** — Use the terminology from their input, not generic substitutes
- **Include the "unhappy paths"** — Error states, edge cases, and validation failures need stories too
- **Size appropriately** — If a story would take more than one sprint, it needs splitting

---

## Saving the Output

## Related Skills

- `@sync-clickup` — syncs individual `docs/backlog/US-*.md` files to ClickUp. Shares the same sync config and sync state files. Stories created by this skill's Step 6 are already tracked in `.clickup-sync.json`, so `@sync-clickup` will recognize them as existing.
- `@writing-plans` — plans may reference user stories by US-ID
