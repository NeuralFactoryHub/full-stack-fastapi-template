# Sync User Stories to ClickUp

You are a DevOps automation assistant. Your job is to synchronize user story markdown files from the local repository to a ClickUp task list, keeping both sides in sync.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the sync-clickup skill to synchronize user stories with ClickUp."

---

## When to Use This Skill

- User says "sync to clickup", "push stories to clickup", "update clickup tasks"
- User wants to create ClickUp tasks from local user story files
- User wants to update ClickUp tasks after editing local user story files
- User asks to check sync status between local stories and ClickUp

---

## Prerequisites

### ClickUp Config

ClickUp target coordinates are the **single source of truth** in
`.claude/project.yml` under `integrations.clickup`:

```yaml
integrations:
  clickup:
    enabled: true
    workspace_id: "<workspace-id>"
    list_id: "<list-id>"
    list_name: "<list-name>"              # optional — human label for API instructions
    default_assignee: "user@example.com"  # optional
    default_status: "planning"            # optional
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `workspace_id` | Yes | ClickUp workspace/team ID |
| `list_id` | Yes | Target list ID |
| `list_name` | No | Human-readable list name for API instructions |
| `default_assignee` | No | Email to assign all new/updated tasks to |
| `default_status` | No | Status to set on new tasks (e.g. `"planning"`, `"backlog"`) |

If `integrations.clickup` is missing (or has no `workspace_id`/`list_id`),
**stop and ask the user** for the ClickUp list URL. Extract IDs from the URL
format: `https://app.clickup.com/{workspace_id}/v/li/{list_id}`

Then add the `integrations.clickup` block to `.claude/project.yml` before proceeding.

### Sync State File

The sync state lives at `docs/backlog/.clickup-sync.json`. It tracks which local stories are mapped to ClickUp tasks:

```json
{
  "US-001": {
    "clickup_task_id": "86c8c737r",
    "clickup_url": "https://app.clickup.com/t/86c8c737r",
    "last_synced": "2026-02-20T14:47:44Z",
    "content_hash": "a1b2c3..."
  }
}
```

If this file doesn't exist, create it as `{}` — all stories will be treated as new.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Configuration

1. Read `integrations.clickup` from `.claude/project.yml` — if missing, ask user for ClickUp list URL and add the block
2. Read `docs/backlog/.clickup-sync.json` — if missing, initialize as `{}`
3. Glob `docs/backlog/US-*.md` to find all local story files

### Step 2: Parse Each Story File

For each `US-*.md` file, extract:

| Field | How to extract |
|-------|---------------|
| **US ID** | From filename: `US-001-some-slug.md` → `US-001` |
| **Title** | First `###` heading, e.g. `### US-001: Add context menu...` → full heading text |
| **Priority** | Line starting with `**Priority:**` → map: Must=High(2), Should=Normal(3), Could=Low(4) |
| **Size** | Line starting with `**Size:**` → kept in description only |
| **Full content** | The entire file content — used as the task markdown description |
| **Dependencies** | Line starting with `**Dependencies:**` — kept in description only |

### Step 3: Compute Content Hash

For each story, compute a simple content hash to detect changes:

```bash
md5 -q docs/backlog/US-001-*.md
```

Compare against `content_hash` in sync state. If different → needs update.

### Step 4: Classify Stories

Sort each story into one of three buckets:

| Bucket | Condition | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **New** | US ID not in sync state | Create task in ClickUp |
| **Modified** | US ID in sync state but hash differs | Update task in ClickUp |
| **Unchanged** | US ID in sync state and hash matches | Skip |

Report the classification to the user before proceeding:

```
Sync plan:
  - CREATE: US-005, US-006 (2 new stories)
  - UPDATE: US-002 (content changed)
  - SKIP: US-001, US-003, US-004 (unchanged)

Proceed?
```

**Wait for user confirmation before executing.**

### Step 5: Resolve Assignee

If `default_assignee` is set in config, resolve the email to a ClickUp user ID using `mcp__claude_ai_ClickUp__clickup_resolve_assignees`:

```
assignees: ["{default_assignee_email}"]
workspace_id: "{workspace_id}"
```

Cache the returned `userIds[0]` for all subsequent create/update calls.

### Step 6: Execute Sync

Read `default_assignee` and `default_status` from the sync config. These are optional — if present, include them in every create/update call.

**Prefer the native ClickUp MCP tools** (`mcp__claude_ai_ClickUp__*`) over Zapier tools — they accept structured parameters directly and are more reliable.

#### For NEW stories — use `mcp__claude_ai_ClickUp__clickup_create_task`:

```
name: "{title}"
list_id: "{list_id}"
priority: "{priority}"          # "urgent" | "high" | "normal" | "low"
status: "{default_status}"      # from config, e.g. "planning"
assignees: ["{user_id}"]        # resolved user ID
markdown_description: "{full file content}"
workspace_id: "{workspace_id}"
```

After creation, capture `task_id` and `task_url` from the response.

#### For MODIFIED stories — use `mcp__claude_ai_ClickUp__clickup_update_task`:

```
task_id: "{clickup_task_id}"
status: "{default_status}"
assignees: ["{user_id}"]
markdown_description: "{full file content}"
workspace_id: "{workspace_id}"
```

### Step 7: Update Sync State

After each successful create/update, update `docs/backlog/.clickup-sync.json`:

```json
{
  "US-001": {
    "clickup_task_id": "86c8c737r",
    "clickup_url": "https://app.clickup.com/t/86c8c737r",
    "last_synced": "2026-02-20T15:30:00Z",
    "content_hash": "d4e5f6..."
  }
}
```

Write the updated sync state file after all operations complete.

### Step 8: Report

Print a summary table:

```
Sync complete:

| Story | Action | ClickUp Task | URL |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----|
| US-001 | skipped | 86c8c737r | https://app.clickup.com/t/86c8c737r |
| US-005 | created | 86c8c79xx | https://app.clickup.com/t/86c8c79xx |
| US-002 | updated | 86c8c73ty | https://app.clickup.com/t/86c8c73ty |
```

## Priority Mapping

| Local Priority | ClickUp Priority | Value |
|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| Must | Urgent | 1 |
| Should | High | 2 |
| Could | Normal | 3 |
| Won't | Low | 4 |

---

## Error Handling

- **ClickUp API fails for one story:** Log the error, skip it, continue with remaining stories. Report failures at the end.
- **Config file missing:** Stop and ask user — never guess workspace/list IDs.
- **Story file has no parseable title:** Use filename as fallback title, warn user.
- **Sync state corrupted:** Re-initialize as `{}` (all stories re-created — ClickUp handles duplicates by different task IDs).

---

## Behavior Guidelines

- **Always confirm before executing** — show the sync plan first
- **Never delete ClickUp tasks** — sync is additive only (create + update, never delete)
- **Preserve sync state** — always write the updated state file after operations
- **One story = one ClickUp task** — never merge or split stories during sync
- **Idempotent** — running sync twice with no local changes should produce no ClickUp API calls
- **Git-friendly** — the `.clickup-sync.json` file should be committed so the team shares sync state
